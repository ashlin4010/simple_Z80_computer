# Simple Z80 Computer
The goal of this project was to build a minimally complex Z80 computer capable of running CP/M. While I have  not yet ported CP/M it should be capable of it.

Truthfully this is the second iteration and adds two useful additions, built in USB to serial converter and a Raspberry Pi zero emulating a terminal.
